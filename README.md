# Programming Questions Repository

This repository contains solutions to 5 programming questions implemented in three different languages: Kotlin, JavaScript, and Python.

## Questions

1. **Question 1**: You are a fashion designer known for your unique and vibrant Ankara designs recently you’ve discovered that some of your fabric patterns change their designs based on the temperature and mood of the wearer you want to create a software application that can predict the changes in the fabric design given the mood and temperature data. Think about the classes you will need to model the changing Ankara and how to predict the changes

2. **Question 2**: The Great Migration Forecast: Every year, millions of wildebeest, zebras and other animals participate in the Great Migration across the Serengeti-Mara ecosystem. As a conservationist you want to develop a software system that models this migration, predicting the movement of the herds based on weather patterns, river levels, and predator locations. Consider what classes you’ll need to represent the animals, the environment, and the various factors that influence migration.
.

3. **Question 3**: Nollywood Movie Planner: As a producer in the booming Nollywood movie industry, you are in charge of multiple film projects at once. Each movie has d naifferent cast members shooting schedules, and budgets. You want to write a program to help manage your film projects efficiently. The software should be able to handle the complexities of scheduling,budgeting ,and coordinating between different movie projects.
.

4. **Question 4**:The Magical Baobab: In a small village,there is a Baobab tree believed to have magical properties. Every season,it bears different types of fruits, each with its own unique power. You’ve decided to create a software system that tracks the changes in the tree and predicts what type of fruit it will bear next season and what powers it will possess. The system should also record the effect of each fruit when consumed.
.

5. **Question 5**:The legendary African Drum Circles: You’re part of a community that hosts one of the largest drum circles in Africa. There are different types of traditional drums used in the circle, each with its unique sound and rhythm. The Djembe, Talking Drum, and such as the material they’re made from and their sizes, but they also have distinct characteristics. For instance, the Talking Drum can mimic the lines of human speech, the Djembe is known for its wide range of tones, and the Bougarabou is noted for its deep,rich bass tones.
You want to create a software model of the drum circle that encapsulates these different types of drums.You wish to include methods for each drum that represent the sound it makes and also group similar drums together.Think about creating a base Drum class that contains properties and methods common to all drums and then create subclasses for each specific type of drum(like Djembe,TalkingDrum,and Bougarabou)
