# You are a fashion designer known for your unique and 
# vibrant Ankara designs recently youâ€™ve discovered that some of your fabric
# patterns change their designs based on the temperature and mood of the wearer 
# you want to create a software application that can predict the changes in the fabric design 
# given the mood and temperature data.
# Think about the classes you will need to model the changing Ankara and how to predict the changes.
